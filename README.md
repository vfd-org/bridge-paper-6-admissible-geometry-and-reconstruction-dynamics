# Bridge Paper 6: Admissible Geometry and Reconstruction Dynamics

This repository contains **Bridge Paper 6 (BP6)** of the *Vibrational Field Dynamics* (VFD) programme.

BP6 elevates reconstruction from an interpretive layer (BP5) to a **conservative dynamical selection principle**:  
**dynamics as admissible geometry evolution under reconstruction constraints**, rather than primitive forces acting on objects.

The formulation is written to remain consistent with the Bridge Paper series (BP4–BP5) while staying explicitly within bridge-paper scope.

**Title:**  
*Admissible Geometry and Reconstruction Dynamics*

**Author:**  
Lee Smart

**Status:**  
First Draft — December 4, 2025

PDF:

## 🔍 Scope and Intent

This paper:

- Treats stabilised geometries as elements of a configuration space \( \mathcal{G} \)
- Defines **admissible histories** via stability and bounded mismatch constraints
- Formulates reconstruction as a **selection rule** on \( \mathcal{G} \)
- Shows how inertial/geodesic structure emerges in the deep-stabilisation/slow regime
- Introduces interaction in the IR as **constraint coupling** on \( \mathcal{G} \times \mathcal{G} \)

This paper **does not** claim:
- a derivation of Lorentz symmetry or GR from first principles
- a quantum theory or quantisation procedure
- a fundamental ontology of spacetime
- observer-primacy or consciousness-based dynamics

## 🔗 Relation to Other Bridge Papers

- **BP3 / BP3.5:** Stabilised geometry and persistence  
- **BP4:** Effective dynamics and emergent inertia  
- **BP5:** Motion as reconstruction-consistent persistence  
- **BP6 (this paper):** Dynamics as admissible geometry evolution (selection under constraints)

BP6 is intended to be read as a constructive continuation of BP5, without re-arguing its interpretation.
