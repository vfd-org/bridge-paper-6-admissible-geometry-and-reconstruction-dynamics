# Bridge Paper 6: Admissible Geometry and Reconstruction Dynamics

This repository contains **Bridge Paper 6 (BP6)** of the *Vibrational Field Dynamics* (VFD) programme.

BP6 elevates reconstruction from an interpretive layer (BP5) to a **conservative dynamical selection principle**:  
**dynamics as admissible geometry evolution under reconstruction constraints**, rather than primitive forces acting on objects.

This first draft (Dec 4, 2025) completes the conceptual arc:
BP3/3.5 → BP4 → BP5 → BP6.

## 🔍 Scope and Intent

This paper:

- Treats stabilised geometric configurations as elements of a configuration space \( \mathcal{G} \)
- Defines **admissible histories** via stability and bounded mismatch constraints
- Formulates reconstruction as a **selection rule** on \( \mathcal{G} \)
- Shows how inertial/geodesic structure emerges in the deep-stabilisation/slow regime
- Introduces interaction in the infrared as **constraint coupling** on \( \mathcal{G} \times \mathcal{G} \)

This paper **does not** claim:
- a derivation of Lorentz symmetry or GR from first principles
- a quantum theory or quantisation procedure
- a fundamental ontology of spacetime
- preferred frames or observer-dependent dynamics

All claims are scoped and conservative.

## 🔗 Relationship to Other Bridge Papers

- **BP3 / BP3.5:** Stabilised geometry and persistence  
- **BP4:** Effective dynamics and emergent inertia  
- **BP5:** Motion as reconstruction-consistent persistence  
- **BP6 (this paper):** Dynamics as admissible geometry evolution (selection under constraints)

BP6 builds on BP5’s reinterpretation and specifies how dynamics is selected without primitive motion.
